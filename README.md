# SQL Python

This is a simple app made with Python and tkinter that is similar to my earlier SQL app using C# and winforms.  The app starts with a form that allows you to connect to a remote server (my local computer) and choose which database you would like to connect to. It then allows you to select a table from the database and read it.
